# DiffFiles
CS 32 Project 4 (File I/O). Used a hash table to determine the differences between an old file and a new file. Wrote those differences into a new file. Also reads the difference file to change the old file to the new file. main.cpp holds the code, the text files are examples of old and new files (those ending with a 1 are the old file and those ending with 2 are the new files).
